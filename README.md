#Worksheet 9: Work in a group to make a poster 
**Note**: programming is often done by one person in silence, but a lot of research shows that we learn better when we talk about what we are learning. That's why we do a group activity today. 

1. Pick a random letter between A and D using the `sample()` function. 
(*hint 1*: first make a vector with the letters A, B, C and D, then pass that vector to `sample()`; *hint 2*: sample() takes two arguments. The first is a vector and the second is the size of the sample you want, in this case 1)

2. Your random letter determines what is your topic for today:
	* A. Functions in R
	* B. Datatypes in R
	* C. Plots in R
	* D. For loops in R

3. Take 5 minutes to write down everything you know about your topic. 
If you run out of ideas, google your topic to find more.

4. Form a group with the others who have the same topic, and make a "poster" in Markdown format (.md) with the most important concepts you collected together *and append/copy it below*.

Functions in R
All functions have 3 parts:
The body, the formals and the enviroment

Heres what you can do within R
Getting Help:

help.start() will take you to a collection of manuals specific to R

Input and output:

load() load the datas written with save

Data Creation:

#Worksheet 11 Do a Swirl tutorial in Rstudio

1. Open Rstudio, install the swirl package using the `install.packages()` function and then load the swirl package using the `library()` command. 

2. Open swirl by typing `swirl()`. When swirl asks you what course you want to do, **choose 1: R Programming**. 
	*	Then there will be the choice between 15 different tutorials. Pick one that looks useful to you. I would not start with the apply functions, but any other tutorial is fine.

3. Make notes here about the most important things you learn in the tutorial you chose: 

##<i><b>I chose the functions within R and it was pretty cool because i leanred how to create, rename, and move a file

Awesome! I hope you like swirl and come back to it later!

#Worksheet 12: Do codeschool TryR chapter 6

1. Why do you think is it more practical to have data in a data.frame then in individual vectors? 

in a data frame, because it keeps everything in line similar to an excel sheet 

2. You've learned three ways to extract a column from a data.frame. Which are they? 

- index number in double brackets
- column name as a string in doubke brakets
- name, $ sign and column name 

3. The `read.table()` and `read.csv()` functions are extremely useful. Which are the different arguments for these functions used in the tutorial?


infantry.txt and targets.csv

***Great. Almost done with all the codeschool stuff!***
